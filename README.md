Propeller-chip firmware Gen2.

This is the firmware for the Parallax Propeller chip to work with the SpiderScope-Gen2 application.

It allows faster data acquisition rates up to about 3000 samples per seconds and on-board averaging up to about 30000 samples per seconds.

This Gen2 uses an improved communication protocol.
